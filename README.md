# Notes Website
I have recently developed a full-stack notes website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, completing the project in just 2 days. The website provides users with a seamless and secure experience for creating, editing, and deleting notes, and includes a login and signup feature for user authentication. The backend of the website is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database for storing notes data. The frontend is developed using React, offering a user-friendly interface for managing notes efficiently.

You can access the deployed version of the notes website at [DEPLOY_LINK](https://yogendranotes.netlify.app/).

### Features:
#### Login and Signup: The website includes a robust login and signup system that allows users to create an account or sign in to access the notes functionality. User authentication is handled securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for enhanced security.

#### Create Notes: Once logged in, users can create new notes by providing a title and content for the note. The notes are stored in the MongoDB database, with a unique identifier assigned to each note for easy retrieval.

#### Edit Notes: Users can edit their existing notes by modifying the title or content as needed. The backend API handles the update request, and the changes are reflected in the database to ensure the latest information is stored.

#### Delete Notes: The website allows users to delete notes that are no longer needed. Users can select a note they want to delete, and the backend API removes the note from the database, providing a seamless and efficient way to manage notes.

#### User-friendly Interface: The website's frontend is developed using React, offering a clean and intuitive interface for users to manage their notes. The notes are displayed in a visually appealing and organized manner, providing a user-friendly experience.

#### Secure Data Storage: The notes data is stored securely in the MongoDB database, ensuring that user information is protected from unauthorized access. The backend API follows best practices for secure data handling and authentication to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data.

I am proud of this project and would be happy to discuss it further on my LinkedIn profile [LINKEDIN_LINK](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yogendrarajpoot/). Feel free to check out the deployed version of the website and the code on my GitHub repository.
